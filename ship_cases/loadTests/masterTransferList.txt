Here, I will be providing instructions on how to execute the various edge-cases designed to test the loading features

Test1: Loading no containers to a Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when no containers are provided to load during running the load function. This would mean the user supplies nothing
Use the file loadNone.txt to perform this task
Step 1: Upload the file loadNone.txt using the Choose File button
Step 2: Click on upload to successfully upload the file
Step 3: Click ont the Load/Unload button to proceed with the unload
Step 4: In the grid page, click on Process, thereby skipping the loading function
Result: You should recieve an error stating "Please select at least one container!"

Test2: Loading multiple containers to the Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when multiple containers are provided to load.
Use the file loadMany.txt to perform this task
Step 1: Upload the file loadMany.txt using the Choose File button
Step 2: Click on upload to successfully upload the file
Step 3: Click ont the Load/Unload button to proceed with the unload
Step 4: In the grid page, click on the Load button to begin entering the boxes to load
Step 5: In the pop-up for "Enter description of container to load:" enter a desired "Name" for your container
Step 6: For the next pop-up "Enter weight of the container:" enter  a desired "Weight" for your container
Step 7: Repeat steps 4 - 6 '3' times
Result: You should see that the 1st Containers goes to (4,2), 2nd to (5,2), 3rd to (6,2) and the last to (7,2)

Test3: Loading containers to a full Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when multiple containers are provided to load.
Use the file loadFull.txt to perform this task
In this case, we are testing what happens when multiple containers are provided to load.
