Here, I will be providing instructions on how to execute the various edge-cases designed to test the loading features

Test1: Loading no containers to a Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when no containers are provided to load during running the load function. This would mean the user supplies nothing
Use the file loadNone.txt to perform this task

Test2: Loading multiple containers to the Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when multiple containers are provided to load.
Use the file loadMany.txt to perform this task
