Here, I will be providing instructions on how to execute the various edge-cases designed to test the unloading features

Test 1: Unloading no containers to a Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when no containers are provided to unload during running the unload function. This would mean the user supplies nothing
Use the file unloadNone.txt to perform this task
Step 1: Upload the file unloadNone.txt using the Choose File button
Step 2: Click on upload to successfully upload the file
Step 3: Click on the Load/Unload button to proceed with the unload
Step 4: In the grid page, click on Process, thereby skipping the unloading function
Result: You should recieve an error stating "Please select at least one container!"

Test 2: Unloading all the containers from a Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when all the containers are unloaded. This would mean the user selects all the containers on the ship to be unloaded
Use the file unloadFull.txt to perform this task
Step 1: Upload the file unloadFull.txt using the Choose File button
Step 2: Click on upload to successfully upload the file
Step 3: Click on the Load/Unload button to proceed with the unload
Step 4: In the grid page, select all the containers (which would turn into remove) and click on Process
Result: The following steps displayed should instruct the user to remove all the containers from the ship

Test 3: Unloading multiple from a Ship:
In this case, we are testing what happens when some the containers are unloaded.
Use the file unloadMany.txt to perform this task
Step 1: Upload the file unloadMany.txt using the Choose File button
Step 2: Click on upload to successfully upload the file
Step 3: Click on the Load/Unload button to proceed with the unload
Step 4: In the grid page, select containers (3,1), (2,2) and (1,4) the containers (which would turn into remove) and click on Process
Result: The following steps displayed should lead to preserving just the container (1,9) on the ship
